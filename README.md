# VertScroller

[The Red Ball Express](https://github.com/jarydpeters/VertScroller/blob/main/assets/sprites/menuLogo.png)

this is a C++ game made using the SDL2 development library.

It is intended to become a vertical scrolling shooter similar to the game Strikers: 1945.

As of now it exists only in the most rudimentary of states with no gameplay as framework is being developed
