_**The Red Ball Express**_ is a C++ game made using the SDL2 development library.

It is intended to become a vertical scrolling shooter similar to the game Strikers: 1945.

As of now it exists almost entirely as a UI development repository. Besides standard functionality provided by the SDL2 library such as graphical display, keyboard and mouse monitoring, and window control, all features and functionality have been built from the ground up.

Once the features of the UI and menu are mature, it will be developed into a generalized subrepo to be able to be used in other projects, while this repo will continue for development of the game _**The Red Ball Express**_

Current features include:

-FPS limiting to prevent excessive computational overhead
-realtime FPS display
-Mouse and keyboard control of menu actions
-Fullscreen toggle
-CRT Scanlines effect toggle
-Standard 16:9 resolution options
-Music and Sound Effects volume sliders
-Save file for persisting options selection
